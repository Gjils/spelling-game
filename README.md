# [Spelling](https://gjils.github.io/spelling-game/)
  
Spelling game is an extention of my previous project. Now you have to choose the correct letter instead the accent. I fully rewrote all code with react

[![Stack](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=figma,react)](https://skillicons.dev)

## Advantages:

* Pleasant UI

* You can choose from 4 tasks

* You can see your stats and level. Data is not reset after reloading
 
* You can switch between dark and light theme and change background color
 
* The app is adaptated for most screen resolutions
